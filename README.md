Hi there ðŸ‘‹ this is blacksheepaul, a person living on earth, also know a little bit about front and back end programming, service operation and maintenance. I am passionate about finding best practices for general things, so-called services for deploying various software or hardware.

In addition to that, I have a very wide range of hobbies and very few dislikes (as opposed to food). In this limited journey of life, we are faced with infinite choices, and I believe that every choice is worth trying.
