Hi there ðŸ‘‹ this is blacksheepaul â€” a human living on Earth, with some experience in both frontend and backend development, as well as service operations and maintenance. I'm passionate about understanding and refining best practices â€” deploying software and hardware as services is one way I enjoy putting that into action.

Outside of that, I have a wide range of hobbies and very few dislikes (except maybe for certain foods ðŸ˜…). In this limited journey of life, we're faced with infinite choices â€” and I believe every choice is worth exploring.
