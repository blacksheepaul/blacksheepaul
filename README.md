## Hi there 👋 this is blacksheepaul

I am currently employed at a company specializing in corporate tax services, where I focus on backend programming for web services, primarily using Golang. I have also accumulated extensive experience with C++, PHP, and JavaScript/TypeScript in my previous roles.

My extensive professional experience and deep personal interest in computer systems enable me to take on diverse roles. I excel in optimizing system performance by analyzing log data and fine-tuning database queries, achieving significant improvements with minimal cost. Additionally, I am proficient in both frontend and backend development, as well as Linux operations. I am capable of independently designing and implementing web-based frontend projects and developing robust, production-ready backend APIs.

Not only am I skilled in programming and development, but I also have a wide range of personal interests. I’m passionate about photography, drones, mountain biking, playing the electric guitar, experimenting with culinary creations 🤔, brewing Italian coffee, and, of course, gaming.

In my 20-something years of life so far, I haven’t found a single field so compelling that I’d give up everything else for it. Within specific domains, I would describe myself as being in the top 10%, rather than the top 1%. For most scenarios, that’s more than enough. That said, I haven’t yet reached the pinnacle of any particular “mountain.” If, someday, I do find one worth dedicating myself to entirely, I know I’ll give it everything I’ve got to climb it.
